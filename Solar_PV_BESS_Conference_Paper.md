# Solar PV and Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) for Urban Rooftop Applications

## 1. Introduction
The increasing demand for sustainable and reliable energy requires innovative solutions for generation and storage. This project focuses on integrating Solar Photovoltaic (PV) systems with a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) to improve energy efficiency, reduce carbon emissions, and provide a scalable model for urban applications, particularly rooftop installations.

Our case study is based on the rooftops of NED University, Karachi, which provides a real-world environment to test this system.

## 2. Methodology
The system integrates solar PV panels with advanced BESS through a structured framework. We selected high-efficiency components such as **LONGi Hi-MO 9 solar panels**, **Sungrow inverters**, and **Huawei LUNA2000 battery packs** for their proven reliability.

- **Design optimization**: DC/AC ratio optimizations reduced energy losses. Tools like **PVsyst** helped run energy simulations, while **SketchUp** was used for spatial planning and rooftop optimization.  
- **Site advantages**: Karachi’s latitude (~24°N) provides excellent solar irradiation. Rooftops were analyzed for their load-bearing capacity, tilt angle of 10°, and azimuth angle of 32.1° for maximum efficiency.  
- **Reliability**: Protection mechanisms like anti-islanding, surge protection, and PID recovery ensured long-term reliability and safety.

## 3. Theoretical Modelling
The system combines solar PV panels with a battery storage solution to reduce intermittency and ensure continuous supply. **Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT)** was used for efficient energy extraction.

Key optimization factors:
- DC/AC ratio to maximize inverter efficiency.  
- Voltage drop minimization for stability.  
- Losses minimized—shading, wiring, and soiling.  

**Performance Results**: PVsyst simulations showed an annual energy yield of **2,537 MWh** with a **performance ratio of 84.01%**, highlighting strong urban rooftop potential.
